Description: Read vector features from OGC Web Feature Services (WFS), 
    OGC API Features (OAPIF), and ArcGIS REST FeatureServer/MapServer 
    endpoints. Uses GDAL's OGR vector drivers via 'gdalraster' for 
    connection handling and returns tibbles with 'wk' geometry columns.
    Provides service discovery, layer listing, capability inspection, 
    and bbox-filtered feature retrieval. Aims to make navigating public 
    vector web services less painful.
