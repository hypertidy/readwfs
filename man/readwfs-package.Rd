\title{readwfs: Read Vector Features from Web Feature Services and Friends}
\description{
Read vector features from OGC Web Feature Services (WFS), OGC API Features (OAPIF), and ArcGIS REST FeatureServer/MapServer endpoints. Uses GDAL's OGR vector drivers via 'gdalraster' for connection handling and returns tibbles with 'wk' geometry columns. Provides service discovery, layer listing, capability inspection, and bbox-filtered feature retrieval. Aims to make navigating public vector web services less painful.
